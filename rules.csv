The object of the game is to capture your opponent's flag.

Each player gets an army of 32 standard pieces, each ranked 1 - 9 in power.
Additionally, each player gets 6 Bombs, a Spy, and a Flag piece.
Each player arranges their pieces on their side of the board before the game begins, leaving two empty rows in the middle.

Pieces can be moved one square in any non-diagonal direction, with the exception of the Scout.
The Scout (rank 9) piece can move an unlimited number of squares in any non-diagonal direction.
The bomb and flag pieces cannot move.
Two lakes in the middle of the board serve as obstacles to movement.

When one piece attacks another, their ranks are compared, and the lower ranked piece is captured and removed from the field.
Example: Marshal (rank 1) vs. Sergeant (rank 7) the Sergeant is captured.
If the two pieces are equally ranked, both are captured.
The Bomb pieces defeat all pieces except for the Miners (rank 8) who have the ability to defuse them.
The Spy is defeated by all pieces except the Marshal (rank 1), however the spy only wins if he attacks first.
Any piece can capture the flag.
